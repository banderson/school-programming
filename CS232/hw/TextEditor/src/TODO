TODO:
 - Read pg 735 in book about Graphical Applications (anything in Head First?)
 - Add Window destroyer (example in the book)

High-level features:
 - Open files
 - Save files
 - Search for text and highlight
 - Search and replace all instances


Questions:



Implementation Notes:
 - Use JFileChooser to open files from disk
 	- http://www.java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0240__Swing/JFileChooserisastandarddialogforselectingafilefromthefilesystem.htm
 	- http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/filechooser.html
 	- http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/javax/swing/JFileChooser.html
 - Use a JTextArea to store the contents of the file
 	- Utilize getCaretPosition(), and other useful functions inherited from this
 	- Use the append() method to add new text
 	- Use getText to get text needed for file
 - Above text area, include buttons to: Quit, Save, Open, Search, Replace
 	- Quit: must ask the user to save [if changes are made]
 	- Save: ask for a file name to save to
 	- Search: prompt for search text and direction
 	- Replace: same as search with another input for text to replace (can only replace forward if that's easier)
 - Use JScrollPane to make the textarea scrollable

Extra Credit:
 - Implement change tracking so user only prompted to save on quitting if the file was actually changed
